Other sequences of tokens have zero probability under the model, so they should never be generated. For the beginning, you just set the first token to be \\*\\*START\\*\\* with probability one. You should keep randomly generating tokens, conditional on their prefix, until you generate the \\*\\*END\\*\\* token. \n",
